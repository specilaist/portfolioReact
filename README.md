## The Issue
* Needing a functional website that displays my comprehension of market technologies and languages like React and CSS.

I started with a simple paper layout and a filler text as a placeholder.
Once I wrote by Bio and what I wanted to include I felt using cards in a grid system would be more aesthetically pleasing to the eye.
